# ArchUnitTS

ArchUnitTS is a library for ensuring software architecture rules in TypeScript & JavaScript projects. It's directly inspired by ArchUnit (but not affiliated with). As of 2025, ArchUnitTS is the #1 software architecture testing library for TypeScript, measured by GitHub stars.

Some of the functionality:

-   Check dependencies between files, folders and slices
-   Check for cyclic dependencies
-   Test for code metrics, eg. coupling and cohesion related ones
-   Test whether the project adheres to a UML architecture diagram
-   Much more.

## Installation

```bash
npm install archunit --save-dev
```
