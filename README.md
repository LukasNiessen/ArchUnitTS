# ArchUnitTS

‚ÑπÔ∏è ArchUnitTS is a library for ensuring software architecture rules in TypeScript & JavaScript projects.

üíö As of 2025, it's the #1 architecture testing library for TS and JS, measured by GitHub stars.

‚ö†Ô∏è The library and its name are directly inspired by the amazing ArchUnit library. However, **we are in no way affiliated with ArchUnit or their team.**

Some of the functionality:

-   Check dependencies between files, folders and slices
-   Check for cyclic dependencies
-   Test for code metrics, eg. coupling and cohesion related ones (eg. LCOM96b)
-   Test whether the project adheres to a UML architecture diagram
-   Much more.

## Installation

```bash
npm install archunit --save-dev
```
